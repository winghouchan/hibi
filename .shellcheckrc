# Enable checking for masked returns
#
# Why:
#
# - Reduces the chances of bugs due to error exit codes being masked in command
#   substitutions.

# Enable requiring braces around variables all the time
#
# ✅ echo "${foo}"
# ❌ echo "$foo"
#
# Why:
#
# - JavaScript string interpolation and Bash parameter expansion is similar.
#   Using the same syntax reduces the mental overhead in reading and writing.
# - Increases consistency as there are times where braces are required; for
#   example, when a string is joined to a variable (`${var}string`), or when
#   setting a default (`${var:=default}`).
# - Smaller diff when adding/removing a substitution, extraction, replacement,
#   etc to a parameter expansion.
